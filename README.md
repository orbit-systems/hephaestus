# Anvil
Anvil is a single-file build tool for C, inspired by tsoding's [nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild).

Anvil is small enough to be **included in your project as source code**.
Just modify Anvil's settings to suit your project, then compile and run it:
```sh
$ cc ./anvil.c -o anvil
$ ./anvil
```
and voila! You can try this out on the example project included, or see it in action in the compiler for the [Mars programming language](https://github.com/orbit-systems/mars/blob/main/anvil.c).

# Usage
Anvil needs this information about your project.

```c
char* project_name  = "";   // final program name 
char* source_dirs[] = {""}; // source code folders
char* build_dir     = "";   // folder for intermediate object files

char* cc            = "";   // (optional) c compiler / linker to use (defaults to what anvil.c is compiled with)
char* output_dir    = "";   // (optional) folder to drop the final executable in (defaults to the main folder)
char* flags         = "";   // (optional) c compiler flags
char* include_dir   = "";   // (optional) c include path
char* link_flags    = "";   // (optional) linker flags

int transparency_mode = 0;  // (optional) if not zero, print the executed commands instead of nice messages
```

Anvil searches all the folders in `source_dirs` for `.c` files, compiles them to
`build_dir`, links them all, and creates an executable in `output_dir`.

# What's the catch?
As of right now, Anvil is still in its pretty early stages, and it's limited in what it can do. For projects with more complex build steps or other languages, 
I'd recommend using more flexible build tools.

As always, pull requests are welcome! I'd love to improve this as much as I can while sticking to the original goal of a small, single-file tool.
